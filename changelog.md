- Only a small part of the lightweight system is implemented:
  - Core classes (also their wxWidgets adapters, where needed):
     - gxObject
     - gxComposite
     - gxRect
     - gxPaintDC
  - Lightweight system:
     - gxLightweightControl
     - gxLightweightSystem
     - gxPainter, gxDcPainter
     - gxVisualElement, gxVisualElement, gxStructuralElement
     - gxRootViewElement
     - gxShape, gxRectangle

- The only sample (gxDraw) only draws a hierarchy of rectangles and supports move.
